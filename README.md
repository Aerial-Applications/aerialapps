This is an mix of HTML5 Boiler Plate, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and my own code, including many references.

I'm using it for our Business site, my Resume site is located at [jessegangi.com].

I'm Still Modifying, and will remove uneccesary stuff as I go.

I'm Still considering minifying eveything when finished.

Please give me credit where it is due.

And as always, contact me if you are interested in hiring me, or with any errors, sugestions, or help.

I also add some unnecessary DIVs, ID's, and Styles for referencing.

So don't be too surprised. ;-)
